# WELCOME / BIENVENIDOS !

For a while all you'll find here is just some basic contact information on how to reach me etc. As I grow fond of this platform I may move to develop the page a bit more. But in the mean time, here is the information you came to find.  


# INTRODUCTION

Thank you for visiting your time in visiting this page. I will assume you know my name, so here are the details on the various ways I can be reached to speak with.

Briefly about me; I work and study in networking and information systems security. Asside from my work/passion, I am a father, open source common lisp developer, vegan, free-market, non-violent, bean-and-rice loving techno-primitivist. To those who are close to me, I am simply known as el gringo culiao lol ;)
