# WELCOME / BIENVENIDOS !

For the time being this will simply remain a landing page for those seeking contact details etc. However, as I grow more and more fond of this platform I may move to develop the page a bit more. So, without further ado.  

# INTRODUCTION

As you may very well know, my name is Stephen Horner. By trade I work and study in the fields of network and information security. My current studies/work have me mostly readying myself for the OSCP certification offered by [Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/)

Outside of work I am a father, open source common lisp developer, vegan, free-market agorist, non-violent, bean-and-rice loving techno-primitivist. And of course to a few of my dear friends and family in Chile I am simply known as gringo culiao lol.
