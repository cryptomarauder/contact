# WELCOME / BIENVENIDOS !

For a while all you'll find here is just some basic contact information on how to reach me etc. As I grow fond of this platform I may move to develop the page a bit more. But in the mean time, here is the information you came to find.  


# INTRODUCTION

Thank you for visiting my github page. If you are here then it is because you were
led here to find my contact information. If so, then you're in the right place.  


Well, as you likely know, my name is Stephen Horner. By profession I work as a 
network and information security professional. Outside of work I am a father, 
open source common lisp developer, vegan, free-market agorist, non-violent, 
bean-and-rice loving techno-primitivist. And of course to a few of my dear 
friends and family in Chile I am simply known as gringo culiao lol.
