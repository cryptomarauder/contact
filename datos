## About Me

Thank you for visiting my github page. If you are here then it is because you were
led here to find my contact information. If so, then you're in the right place.

Well, as you likely know, my name is Stephen Horner. By profession I work as a 
network and information security professional. Outside of work I am a father, 
open source common lisp developer, vegan, free-market agorist, non-violent, 
bean-and-rice loving techno-primitivist. And of course to a few of my dear 
friends and family in Chile I am simply known as gringo culiao lol.
